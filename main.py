st.write("""Based on the analysis, I have observed that Texas had the highest overall occurrences of human trafficking, with cases aroung 186548. Hennepin County, Minnesota had the highest number of cases among for all counties in the United States. The western region is showing the highest individual data points recorded but a larger overall number of cases regionally in the South.
Data reporting has steadily increased each year since reporting began in 2013. Its important to note that reporting may be incomplete or partial in 2013 and should be taken into account when comparing to other years in the dataset. In this 8-year dataset, there were a total of 13056 reported cases of human trafficking, 3264 of which were deemed unfounded and 6976 cases were solved, or cleared.
Over 64% of city police departments are reporting human trafficking cases. County law enforcement departments make up 25% of reporting, with state police bringing in 8% of reported cases and Tribal police departments reporting just .3% of cases overall. While Seminole County, Florida has reported four of eight years, they are reporting a 100% success rate for solving cases in every year reported.
That’s not the case for other departments.
Just like getting to know people, the more we interact with something, the more we get to know it and are sometimes surprised by what we learn. For purposes of practicing curiosity, if I were to continue studying this data, I would immediately dig deeper into the fact that some 54.35% of the human trafficking cases reported to the FBI are going unsolved each year. That seems a grave number to admit and warrants more investigation. Assuming one person equals one case, that’s 6080 people who continue to be victimized, subjected into slavery, sexual or otherwise in this country, since 2013. This is a huge concern and has eclipsed my initial questions.""")
